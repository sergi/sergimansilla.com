I am currently the Director of Platform at [Glovo](https://glovoapp.com/en/). Before that, I worked on the core of <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/">Firefox OS</a> along with <a href="https://mozilla.com">Mozilla</a>, and I designed Node.js systems for <a href="http://www.telenor.com/about-us/our-business/telenor-digital/">Telenor Digital</a>. I also do public speaking about software development around the world.

In the more remote past, I helped build Cloud9, <a href="http://c9.io">an IDE that runs entirely on JavaScript and Node.JS</a>. I also led the team that implemented the framework powering the visual interface in <a href="http://tomtom.com">TomTom</a> GPS devices.

I am also the co-founder of an NGO that aims to create peace through technology, <a href="https://justpeacelabs.org">JustPeace Labs</a>.

I love to tinker with software in my free time, check out my <a href="https://github.com/sergi">GitHub profile</a> to see what I'm up to lately. One of my interests is Reactive Programming, which <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/smreactjs/reactive-programming-with-rxjs">I wrote a book about for Pragmatic Programmers</a>.

I am now back in the lovely city of Barcelona after living in Amsterdam for many years, where, among other things, I organized the popular <a href="http://www.meetup.com/AmsterdamJS/">AmsterdamJS meetup</a>.
