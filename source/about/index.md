I am currently the Director of Platform at [Glovo](https://glovoapp.com/en/). Before that, I worked on the core of [Firefox OS](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/) along with [Mozilla](https://mozilla.com), and I designed Node.js systems for <a href="http://www.telenor.com/about-us/our-business/telenor-digital/">Telenor Digital</a>. I also do public speaking about software development around the world.

In the more remote past, I helped build Cloud9, [an IDE that runs entirely on JavaScript and Node.JS](https://c9.io) (recently acquired by Amazon). I also led the team that implemented the framework powering the visual interface in [TomTom](https://tomtom.com) devices.

I am also the co-founder of an NGO that aims to create peace through technology, <a href="https://justpeacelabs.org">JustPeace Labs</a>.

I love to tinker with software in my free time, check out my <a href="https://github.com/sergi">GitHub profile</a> to see what I'm up to lately. One of my interests is Reactive Programming, which <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/smreactjs/reactive-programming-with-rxjs">I wrote a book about for Pragmatic Programmers</a>.

I now live in the lovely Barcelona after living in Amsterdam for many years, where among other things, I organized the popular <a href="http://www.meetup.com/AmsterdamJS/">AmsterdamJS meetup</a>.
