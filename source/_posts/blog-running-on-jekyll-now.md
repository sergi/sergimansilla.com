That’s right, I couldn’t resist switching to [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). I feel so free now! For those who don’t know, Jekyll is a static site generator. It takes a template directory, runs it through a textile or markdown parser, and outputs a complete website ready to be served with any web server, since it is simple HTML. That means no more server queries or content stored in databases. You own your content, and it is stored in plain text files. Of course, that also means that it is perfect to be maintained with a VCS like [Github](http://www.github.com), where by the way, you can host your Jekyll sites for free! Ah, simplicity… You can see [the source code for my blog](http://github.com/sergi/sergi.github.com) and get a feeling of how it works.
