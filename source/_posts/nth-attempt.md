Yes, I am blogging again. But this time I have a plan. My last blog tried to cover too many things, from my life abroad, to ramblings on software engineering and even some poor attempts to deep thinking every other post. Well, you really canâ€™t bite off more than you can chew, and that was too broad and disorganized to maintain it properly, so this time the theme of this blog will be quite specific: programming and software engineering (mainly), focusing on languages, techniques and my day-to-day development. I already have some few articles prepared, and many ideas for future ones. Stay tuned!
